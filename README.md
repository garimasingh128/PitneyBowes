# PitneyBowes
Project for Pitney Bowes Shipping Hackathon on Hackerearth.
OVERVIEW
This is an application specially designed for delivery boys that helps tracks their orders  comfortably by providing them the shortest route available for delivery and connecting them  directly with the admin of the company who assigns orders to them. 
Their will be a separate app for admins. This application gives a function which builds a link  between Admin and the Delivery boy. Through this application, the admin can assign a delivery  boy to order and track them. 
This helps in rendering a better service of shipping as everything is monitored by the admin with  the help of an application which works on your phone.
